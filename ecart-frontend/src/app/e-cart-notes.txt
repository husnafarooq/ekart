                E cart - frontend
    1. Create a new folder e cart
    2. inside in it Create a new angular project - ng new ecart-frontend
    3. Instll 3rd party libraries
            ->mdbootstrap - npm i

    4.Lazy loading
        Lazy loading is a technology of angular that allows you to load JavaScript
        components when a specific route is activated. It improves application load
        time speed by splitting the application into many bundles. When the user 
        navigates by the app, bundles are loaded as needed.
        Lazy loading helps to keep the bundle size small, which helps reduce load times. We
        must use the class decorator to create an Angular module @NgModule, and the decorator
        uses a metadata object that defines the module.        
    5. Create a module in angular - here we create product module for implementing
        lazy loading
        -ng g m products --route products --module app.module
    6. Create component in lazy loading module(product module)
        ->ng g c products/allProducts
        ->ng g c products/viewProducts
        -> ng g c products/wishlist
        ->ng g c products/cart

    7. components that does not included in lazy loading
        ->ng g c header
        ->ng g c footer
        ->ng g c pageNotFound
    8. Setup path in products routing.module

    localhost 4200 - all products
